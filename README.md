# InstaGroups (Second Project)
This Rails Application is a prototype of grouping website for instagrammers to set up their own group page instead of using one single handle. They would be able to use their own handles to post pictures into the groups and also schedule their own meetups(later feature). It is still currently underwork, but at least everything in the backend is functional. 

## Technologies Used
1. Ruby on Rails
2. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/3beazRQl/instagroup)
3. Bootstrap(still working on it)
4. PostgreSQL
5. UploadCare

### Planning Stage
I mainly used Trello to do the planning. I drew the relationship table with draw.io. I also used Trello checklist to make sure the user stories works accordingly, but there are still things I still have to work on in order to make the site look pretty. 

#### How to contribute?
1. fork/clone my repo
2. gem install in your terminal in the "cwd"
3. put in some work :D
4. submit a pull request

Any help would be appreciated. There are a lot of stuff that could be added to this project such as adding admins and refactoring codes. Thanks in advance :)
